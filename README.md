# Employee-Managment-System
The program aims towards removing the hustle of physical management of the worker's data. The physical organization of workers data on a large scale becomes extremely tedious and it can cause many errors resulting in the huge losses for the company. In the case of megaprojects, where a large number of workers are to be deployed onto a project site, this software effectively and efficiently clears out the clutter giving the user clear data of each employee. it saves time and provides a smooth operation.
